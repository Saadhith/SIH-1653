SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

Smart Recruitment and Assessment Platform (like RAC) Idea: Develop a smart recruitment platform powered by AI and Machine Learning (ML) to streamline and optimize the recruitment process for defense-related roles. This system would integrate recruitment, testing, and evaluation for both military and civilian technical roles.
Key Benefits:

Efficiency: Streamlining the selection process ensures faster induction of skilled professionals. Data-Driven Decisions: AI can objectively score candidates, enhancing fairness and reducing bias in selection. Better Matching: The platform can match candidates' skills with job roles, ensuring that each individual is placed in the most suitable position within the defense ecosystem. Features:

Simulated Interviews: Virtual boardroom simulations for candidates to interact with experienced defense experts. Skill Mapping: Matching candidates' technical and managerial skills to the exact needs of the role. Real-Time Evaluation: AI-driven tools to evaluate responses and interview performance to assist in making quick decisions. 2. Defense Technology Incubators and Startups Support Idea: Promote innovation in defense technologies by establishing defense-specific technology incubators or supporting startups through government funding, mentorship, and collaborative programs with DRDO and the private sector.
